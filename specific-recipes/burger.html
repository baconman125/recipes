    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A huge single or triple burger with all the fixings, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and special sauce or mayonnaise!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Halapeno Peppers</li>
            <li>4 Pounds Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>8 Hamburger Buns</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a grill for <strong>high heat</strong>. When the grill is hot, roast the jalapeno peppers until
            <br>blackened on all sides. Place in a plastic bag to sweat and loosen the blackened skin. 
            <br>Rub the skin off, then seed if desired, and chop.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, use your hands to mix together the chopped jalapenos, ground beef, 
            <br>salt, pepper, egg, steak sauce, onion, hot pepper sauce, oregano, Worcestershire 
            <br>sauce, garlic salt and FritosÂ®. Divide into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.</li>
            <li>Grill patties for 10 to 15 minutes, turning once, or until well done. I always drink one 
            <br>beer, then flip, drink another beer, then remove from the grill and place on buns. 
            <br>Top each one with a slice of pepperjack cheese and pig out!</li>

        </ol>
